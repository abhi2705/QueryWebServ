I am a computer science engineering student and I love my field. Anything related to computer science and I am inquisitive for it. I love coding/programming. I love to learn about the latest technologies coming up, like more recently, Microsoft has launched a ‘split’ keyboard and has also come up with the Sculpt Ergonomic Mouse. I want to be updated. Besides I love to surf the internet and a regular 'Facebook' visitor.But besides computer science, I extend my love for many more science and technology fields. For me building a healthy career requires extensive knowledge. Knowledge is power and only makes a person wiser. So for me, knowledge(and education included) is of high priority. However I must mention that I am not a book-worm in any sort.|"In the student chapter of CSI, conducted along with the Department of Computer Science and Engineering of IMS Engineering College, I liked the event Technical Paper/Presentation, and actively participated in this event by presenting a technical paper on 'Spintronics'.

Hence, if there was a system in place which would let's say allow the students to put in their roll no. on a device in the shop and make the purchase. The amount can be added to a 'dues' category of the student's data which can be paid off with the next fees payment. Cons - This might lead to students spending too much at times causing them burn a huge hole in their parents' pockets. Can be controlled by putting a monthly limit or something like that.|Since I had CS in PU level, I have an 'ok' programming background and am decent with C++.As my class XII project, I made a basic Fantasy Football program with a friend.

I'm enthusiastic to learn. I'm looking for a platform to learn.I'm interested in programming.|TECHNITES.The laser gun in technites was awesome.I'm very much interested to work in the technites committee.Also, NITK STREET VIEW is very impressive.I would like to be a part of Street view project||C- 4C++-4Java-3html,css,java script-2|I would like to design an app which when installed,college news and updates will be delivered.

I liked the first rd of rtfm. The questions it had were extremely interesting and challenging and was really fun to solve. The rounds in pangea were also really intersting. They had actively incorporated some elements of electronics or robotics in each rd and and even the math puzzles were fun to solve. And their last rd which was based on solving a murder mystery with different ppl actually playing the role of the various characters of the story was very different and well- thought out.|||||Matlab, C++ or Embedded C|I would want to build a robot which can navigate through a building by itself(no remote control is used). So this project would use image processing more specifically how to handle the data being sent by camera feed, object recognition etc. This robot could be used like a surveillance-bot.|I completed a course on Robotics with embedded C with technophilia systems. I also did some small projects involving robotics and image processing. I made a very basic line follower capable of navigating through a track which has intersections. I also made a image processing robot whose motion is controlled by the movement of coloured object. I also worked on Matlab and designed some filters and passed some music files through these filters to remove certain elements of the track.||||B.Tech|Yes|||
