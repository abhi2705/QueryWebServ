I want to gain more knowledge in my field, apart from just the course that is taught to us in college. As its the era of computers, I want to contribute in some way or the other, by doing some innovative thing that is productive to the society as a whole. Also, I would like to contribute to this prestigious club in entrepreneurship related things. Start-ups, new businesses, ideas to make your company grow constantly, etc have always been a good food to my brain. I also want to develop my marketing skills as well as entrepreneurial skills by interacting and brainstorming with like-minded people. |I am interested in programming and areas like entrepreneurship, learning about building start-ups and doing projects related to technical stuff. At the same time, its also important that I learn something from whatever I do. At every stage, even if I do something very small, it should be productive. Interacting with people, developing my soft skills, and groom my personality as a whole is a thing very important to me. |I have worked on not many technical softwares. I dont have much technical knowledge at present stage but, I surely want to learn a lot in the coming years in my field, i.e. Computer Science. I know basic C programming and want to get into app development and related stuff. My experience is not good enough in softwares related to technical stuff but I certainly want to improve upon these things in future. |I want to do projects related to technical things through which we can get to know the audience of any product or service and use it to know things they look for most.

I have two poems till now, which are a part of my original work.|NONE|NONE|NONE|NONE|I have studied Economics as my additional subject in classes 11th and 12th. I think, this gives me a leading edge over other people in this field. Concepts of Demand and Supply, GDP, NDP are things that help in developing, and getting to know the feasibility of a product or a service that needs to be created. It also helps us understand how the development of a product affects the economy of a country.|My specific area of interest is Entrepreneurship. I like to work according the Lean Start-up Methodology which is a must for building a successful start-up. Marketing and publicising a product are the most important things after the creation of a utility and I am interested in that.|NONE|I have worked on Image editing, sound editing and a little over video-editing softwares. To mention, Adobe Photoshop, Windows Movie Maker, Audacity (to record and enhance sound or audio tracks ) and a little bit over Sony Vegas. I like doing photo editing in free time and develop something that looks good, just for pleasure. Also, sound editing is a thing I like a lot. I record songs and edit them on my own. Putting effects, enhancing sound quality are a part of it. |Yes. Adobe Photoshop  2.5 Sony Vegas  1 Windows Movie Maker  4 |NONE|My favourite event last year was The Apprentice. The way it was held was brilliant. Group discussions were there, personal interviews took place. I even had to break my head filling up the resume for the same but it was real fun. And then teams were formed. The best part of the event was working in teams till the end of the game and at last it is just that one person who becomes THE Apprentice. Meeting new people, working and brainstorming over ideas with them, taking help of seniors who are your mentors, were part of an amazing experience that I had. Also, it taught me a lot because we did so much. Photo advertisement, video ads, marketing plans, pitching your ideas and everything that made me learn something at every stage. Also, the deadlines set for each thing kept me busy working over it day and night, and made me feel good. Also other events like the Big Fight, Jugaad and  Around the world in 127 minutes were really good. |Yes|NONE|NONE|12.50|12.00|0.00|0.00|NONE|NONE|NONE|0|NONE|NONE|NONE|0|NONE|NONE|NONE|0|NONE|NONE|NONE|0|NONE|NONE|NONE|0|NONE|NONE|NONE|NONE|0|NONE|NONE|0|False|False|False|False|False|False|False|Yes|NONE|NONE|NONE|NONE|NONE|NONE|NONE

The problem statement for final round was to build up a hydraulic crane using syringes and icecream sticks. Damn, the problem statement was challenging. It further ignited me from within to take up this challenge and finish it off in style. So we started building it up with great efforts. We sat with it till 5 a.m. in the morning to finish it.

Coding, literature and business are topics I have always been interested in, and getting to work with like-minded students would be incredible. |I love coding, art and literature/creative writing. These are all things I could do for hours on end without even noticing the time pass. A lot of things are important to me - my family and friends; my studies; having fun. It's been an interesting experience in college learning to manage everything at once. |I've worked on Turbo C v3.0 and v4.5. I much preferred the latter for programming in C++, as it had a more user-friendly interface.|I'm really interested in the idea of having a college app, as mentioned during the pre-recruitment talk. It would definitely be something that all of our students could contribute to and benefit from, and getting the opportunity to be a part of making that happen would be incredible. I also love the CSI website, and hope to be able to help out with that aspect as well. I had an idea for an app over the summer (astronomy related), but realized later that the same had already been created. I don't have any knowledge in the app development area, but I would love to learn more and hopefully contribute something unique to the tech world sometime soon. Being a member of CSI would help me immensely to further that aim. |I participated in a CSI coding competition two years ago and loved the experience. The members of the club were very knowledgeable and helpful, and I was excited to learn that I had, in NITK, the chance to apply to become a member of this reputed club.|NONE|NONE|NONE|My literary interests are as diverse as diverse can be. I've always been fascinated by anything that can be read, from fantasy to Shakespeare and everything in between. |I do have quite a bit of experience in this area - I've published two short stories through competitions held by Scholastic; written and edited editions of my high school newspaper, journal and yearbook; placed second in an international spelling bee; and have scripted, directed and acted in several plays in high school and college. I always enjoy the work put into making a story, article or play just perfect. |I spend a lot of my free time reading. I believe in reading for the pleasure of the same, not solely to gain bookish knowledge. I enjoy reading pieces that, rather than compiling ideas, actually display the writer's imagination and creativity, because it's like getting a glimpse into a stranger's personality, to the point where they're not really strangers any more. That's something I have always, and will always find amazing. |NONE|NONE|NONE|My knowledge in finance isn't extensive - it's limited to the US stock market, in which my parents have invested. I have been helping them with their decisions and transactions for years. I think the stock market is a great way to learn decision-making skills - when to take risks, and when to play it safe. |My interests in finance lie solely in the stock market. As previously mentioned, I have helped my parents in the same, and I enjoy stalking stocks (haha) and deciding which ones would be good choices in the short or long term. A lot of research has to go in before a decision can be made.|NONE|NONE|NONE|NONE|I think Apprentice was my favorite (CSI) event last year. It's nice to know that even in an engineering college, our interests need not be purely technical - I admire that CSI provided the first years with the opportunity to learn and grow in different spheres of knowledge, something you wouldn't learn in a classroom. I also commend Big Fight. It's good to encourage students to take matters into their own hands in a productive yet practical way. It also prepares us for the future, when such problem solving skills will be an asset and a necessity. Most of all, I truly admire CSI's social initiatives. I believe that it is our moral responsibility to give back to society however we can, and I hope to help out especially in the Shiksha and Vidyaarthi programs. I love to teach and being able to make a difference, if even a small one, in a student's life would be amazing.|Yes|NONE|NONE|0.00|0.00|0.00|0.00|NONE|NONE|NONE|0|NONE|NONE|NONE|0|NONE|NONE|NONE|0|NONE|NONE|NONE|0|NONE|NONE|NONE|0|NONE|NONE|NONE|NONE|0|NONE|NONE|0|False|False|False|False|False|False|False|Yes|NONE|NONE|NONE|NONE|NONE|NONE|NONE

It was the perfect platform to express creativity, show off our speaking and acting skills, and to top it all up, it was fun! We were the winning team, and we put up a really good show. None of us had practiced before hand or even gone through the script until about 15 minutes before the actual show. Everything on stage acted on the spot and though a little tensing, it's definitely something I won't forget.

One such field that has never failed to surprise me with its innovations is computer science and programming. What is more important to me than learning about these cool things is to implement them in real world situations and invent new ideas technologies with them! Something that is equally important to me is sharing what ever I have learnt with those who want a piece of it. This not only allows others to also pursue in ideas that I am interested in, but their interpretations of the same subject could lead to new ideas and breakthroughs in the same. Thus being a symbiotic process!|The softwares i have worked on are:- c,c++ and java. My experience in learning and working through the different generations of software has been a wonder full one. The jump from a procedural oriented language to that of object oriented ones is such an eye opener!

I no longer see any problem or solution as the path of a narrow road, but that of various branched paths of unlimited possibilities!|I have no complete project ideas in mind.
